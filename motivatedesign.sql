623	6947577	Product Designer	New York, NY	<section>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Product Designer for Biz Applications Startup Founded by Google, Facebook, and Big Data Alums</strong><br />\n <br />\nA tight-knit, world-class 20-person team devoted to turning complex technologies into real, bottom-line business solutions. Founders from Google, Facebook, and a Big Data pioneer. Weekly lunches and fun, take-a-load-off, team-building activities. Steps from the subway.<br />\n <br />\nHard to pass up, right?<br />\n <br />\nThis 2-year old startup—loaded with funding from well-known investing partners, including Sequoia Capital, and Fortune 500 clients—needs a <strong>UX Designer</strong> to help design and build data-driven, marketing-centric business applications that drive revenue. Everyone here is mad about data—about optimized system performance and tackling complicated algorithmic problems. Ideally, you should be, too.<br />\n <br />\nThis is a “full-stack” design position—responsible for research, design, <em>and need to</em> have knowledge of development. This is a young company and everyone else is a jack-of-all-trades, get-your-hands-wet member of the team.<br />\n <br />\nWorking with the Head of Product Design and a team of nimble engineers (you need to know how to speak ‘engineer’), you’ll develop prototypes based on user research, which you’ll be heavily involved with—and not just developing prototypes, validating concepts, and translating data into design. You’ll organize and conduct user research studies, too. They’d love your help talking up to non-designers the benefits and components of what good design looks like.<br />\n <br />\nThey’re looking for someone with at least 4 years of experience designing interfaces and shipping web applications, PLUS an academic degree in Human Computer Interaction, Interaction Design, or something similar. Do you get a kick out of making complex data look simple? Perfect!<br />\n <br />\nYou should know how to develop interactive prototypes in your sleep, and the ins and outs of UX and UI design processes and methodologies. Be prepared to show you’re familiar with agile process development and working with engineers. Remember: speak engineer! UI libraries are already in place, but you must show experience in building prototypes. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript is nice, but not critical; and though you won’t be coding, knowledge of code is helpful.<br />\n <br />\nIn such a small organization, everyone’s a self-starter and you should be, too. You should show that you’ve come up with original ideas and fresh approaches—and transformed them into something beautiful, but also useful and valuable. It goes without saying that your portfolio is stunning. But it should demonstrate how your designs have addressed and resolved user needs across a variety of contexts.

801	7813504	Interaction Designer - Product	New York, NY	<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interaction Designer (Product) at Big-Time Video Tool Tech Leader/Shop</strong><br />\n <br />\nProactive.<br />\nPassionate.<br />\nStrategic.<br />\nDo these words describe you?<br />\n <br />\nThen you’ll be happy to know that a big-time tech leader wants someone just like you—an <strong>Interaction Designer</strong> with more than 3 years of experience designing web products to oversee design of interaction models for products that millions of users engage with every day.<br />\n <br />\nWorking side-by-side with a UX Researcher and Product Designer, you’ll own the design of all products you’re assigned to. Your mandate is to help the team design and develop interaction models for products that don’t simply function, but that touch users on an emotional level. You want them bawling, shouting, or laughing at their screens! <br />\n <br />\nFlexibility is key here. Be proactive when working by yourself. But with teammates—not just designers and product managers, but developers, too—you’ll need to keep an open mind about their contributions and value feedback on yours. You’ll have to demonstrate you’ve worked collaboratively before, but also show that you’re comfortable articulating—clearly—your design decisions. No one wants to work with a wet noodle!<br />\n <br />\nMore specifically, you’ll manage the visual design language, patterns, and assets for all your web and mobile application projects. That includes iteration, sketching, and prototyping user-centric solutions. And you’ll be asked to contribute your talents to those projects you’re not assigned to. For every product initiative, you’ll also need to advocate for standard design principles—usability, rich user experience, and clear and elegant interaction. The ultimate, bottom-line requirement? Deliver beautiful, functional, application front-end experiences in an agile environment.<br />\n <br />\nThe company is looking for someone with: deep knowledge of responsive web design, mad skills in visual as well as <strong>kinematic</strong> (how things move) aspects of UI design; expertise in standard web design tools—Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, Invision/Marvel, and Proto.io/Principle; and HTML and CSS. No need for actual coding experience, but you do have to know what’s code-able. Web development knowledge could help, too, but lack of it won’t hurt.<br />\n <br />\nSince you’ll be working so closely with researchers, you must be able to incorporate research—and product—data into your design processes. Be sure to demonstrate your ability to create systematic design experiences for wildly different customer interactions and needs via a robust and defined user experience. Show, too, that you are both resourceful and flexible about scalable and seamless web experiences. Oh, and a great interaction design portfolio helps, too!</div>	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Closed	2016-07-13 20:00:18.024724	2016-10-21 00:00:09.819186	Animoto	In-house	t	UX Design, Product Design, UI Design, Interaction Design

633	7515637	UX Lead	New York, NY	<div><strong>UX Lead at Flexible, Fun, Flatiron Firm</strong><br />\n<br />\nDid we say fun? This design shop loves dogs, summer Fridays, yoga breaks, and Halloween. And they know you like to have fun on your own time. That’s why they have week-long shutdowns in December <em>and</em> July.<br />\n <br />\nBut they know how to get down to business, too, with 2015 Best Place to Work awards from both <em>Crain’s New York</em> and <em>AdAge</em> and a people-centric (not just user-centric) ethic underpinned by a focus on live prototyping and proof-of-concepts, human insights strategy, and having a sixth sense of what clients really want.<br />\n <br />\nNow this 50-person design shop is looking for a <strong> UX Lead </strong>with at least 6 years of UX Design or product development experience to lead a passionate team that dabbles in just about everything<strong>—</strong>research, strategy, concepting, client workshops, interaction design, user journeys, personas, site maps, wireframes, prototyping and testing/validation—in order to produce enterprise and app experiences that balance business objectives, user needs, and technical complexity.<br />\n <br />\nIn addition to the usual responsibilities of a Director—owning the quality, planning, and completion of all deliverables—you’ll need to define and execute correct research and testing processes. Stakeholder relations are key here. Externally, you’ll interact closely with clients to define the vision and prioritize requirements and functional needs, and manage any outward-facing presentations. Internally, you’ll work with project information architects, UX/interaction designers and visual designers. And this tight-knit group thrives on collaboration; they’ll expect you to share UX knowledge and champion UX and UCD principles throughout the company. Sharing is caring!<br />\n <br />\nQualities they’re looking for include a can-do spirit, experience with large, complex, digital projects—and a focus on clean, modern, high-quality design that doesn’t ignore user research or technical requirements.

You’ll need at least 4 years experience as Design Director, Creative Director, Senior Designer or the equivalent—and a BS degree in computer in computer science, electrical engineering, information systems, industrial design or something similar.<br />\n <br />\nThe role involves a lot of teamwork, guidance, and overseeing design <em>and</em> development projects and processes—that includes creating and maintaining SOPs—from concept to completion (prototypes, etc). You’ll work with Content Strategists and Designers to ensure deliverables align with the company’s global brand look-and-feel and meet all management and customer expectations. Designers need to be challenged to take ownership of client feedback. External partners are equally important and must be assured projects are financially competitive.<br />\n <br />\nGiven the subject matter, you’ll need to keep up on best practices in healthcare application design, general life sciences research, and key healthcare publications and audiences. And get ready to rack up valuable miles—domestic and international travel make up roughly 35% of your time!<br />\n <br />\nWhat else should you bring to the table? Did we say teamwork? Ideally, you should demonstrate experience in managing teams tasked with design, brand strategy, and web application and digital product development. An ability to “speak technology” is key, so those folks can eventually implement your vision and plans. This client is keen on process so you’ll also need to have put together airtight design vision and execution maps, as well as methodology for building sophisticated web applications<strong>. </strong>It will also help if you’re big on cultural sensitivity and managing wildly different expectations—you’re going to work closely with international customers.<br />\n <br />\nReady to throw your hat in the ring?<br />\n 	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Active (1)	2016-08-10 16:00:18.6941	2016-08-10 20:00:10.542137	Veryday	In-house	t	\N

PLUS—they’re known for cultivating a nurturing, caring environment stacked with people who have endless reserves of curiosity, professionalism, and creative drive. Believe us—you’ll want to work here!<br />\n <br />\nThe role calls for an eager and nimble collaborator, articulate communicator, and infectious motivator. With a focus on healthcare products, you’ll team up with cosmopolitan, multi-lingual co-workers (and if you speak another language, your odds improve!) in Design Strategy, Visual Design, Development, and Research.<br />\n <br />\nPrepare to get your hands good and wet on a little bit of everything—concepting, prototyping, design stories, wireframes, user requirement analysis, task analysis, UI design, information architecture design (using participatory and iterative design techniques), and usability testing. You’ll review and evaluate product design for all the usual attributes that thrill clients—usefulness, aesthetic appeal, usability, accessibility, adherence to technical requirements, and benefit to the bottom line.<br />\n <br />\nJust as important—you’ll communicate research findings, decision decisions, design stories, and conceptual ideas to your colleagues and clients. Storytelling is key here—perhaps no surprise given the international makeup of the organization—and you should be comfortable showing and telling, verbally and in presentations. They run a tight ship, too.

It routinely leads the list of consultancies name-brand businesses from every industry call on for help.

Once they become available, findings need to be translated into news everyone can use—design, marketing, and key business decision-makers. Here is where your experience putting together things like personas, customer journey maps, and service blueprints comes in handy.<br />\n <br />\nTo accomplish all of this, you’ll need to be able to work closely and collaborate with others (sometimes from other countries and cultures): designers, developers, product managers, software architects, and other stakeholders to figure out opportunities for product improvement and success—and determine the right experiments to measure, test, and yield actionable insights.<br />\n <br />\nProduct managers and marketing will want to discuss how your insights inform value propositions and selling points. Designers will use your research data for their creative—prototypes, concepts, and actual product designs—and ask for your input and advice.

809	8009494	Product Design Lead	New York, NY	Like Kleenex® and Coca-Cola®, our client’s brand has become synonymous with the product itself. When CEOs and COOs think of top-notch management consulting, they think of this ubiquitous multinational firm. Our client takes its reputation seriously. But that doesn’t mean they rest on their laurels. They’re constantly thinking of new ways to create digital technologies that transform the way businesses work.<br />\n <br />\nAnd that’s where you come in. If you’ve got over 5 years of experience in mobile and web design (ideally, in an enterprise solutions setting), plus some other nifty attributes, its Innovation group needs a <strong>Product Design Lead</strong>.<br />\n <br />\nAs Product Design Lead reporting to the group’s Director, you’ll….well, <em>take the</em> <em>lead</em> on crafting the UI, developing concepts, prototypes (interaction models, screen designs, and user workflows), wireframes, and mockups that can instantly translate into user stories as well as code.<br />\n <br />\nBut you’ll also contribute to research, ideation & concepting, and product development & delivery—which is why an ability to look at solutions conceptually <em>and </em>pragmatically is so critical. Collaboration is the name of the game here—and you’ll interface regularly with Product Management, Design, Development, Engineering, and Data Analysis. You’ll review and refine design during product development cycles, and provide input on how users would want to interact with an application. You’ll provide expertise on quantitative and qualitative user research: crafting questions, conducting activities, and translating insights. That’s why you need to show you’ve worked with numerous partners before—international partners, too.<br />\n <br />\nUser-centered and iterative design practices—not to mention solid UI skills and expertise with Invision, Adobe suite, OmniGraffle, and Sketch, as well as agile software development practices—are a must. You should want to constantly upgrade those and learn about the newest digital tools and technologies, too.<br />\n <br />\nThough collaboration—as we said—is key, you need to be self-motivating and self-directing on your own tasks, and not shy in reaching out to stakeholders for their input or support. In that sense, be a mentor and a master communicator, clear and concise on why your designs serve the user and the business. There could be some travel—domestic and overseas. Oh, and a sense of humor always helps. But not too much—not everyone loves a joker!	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Active (1)	2016-08-23 00:00:13.92551	2016-08-26 16:00:11.317152	McKinsey & Company	In-house	t	Product Design

It routinely leads the list of consultancies name-brand businesses from every industry call on for help. Why not take the opportunity to add their name to your resume?<br />\n <br />\nYour prime directive here is to design and conduct user research experiments (usability testing, interviews, vision workshops, survey design, ideation and design workshops, concept tests) for every stage of a product’s life cycle. Once they become available, findings need to be translated into news everyone can use—design, marketing, and key business decision-makers. Here is where your experience putting together things like personas, customer journey maps, and service blueprints comes in handy.<br />\n <br />\nTo accomplish all of this, you’ll need to be able to work closely and collaborate with others (sometimes from other countries and cultures): designers, developers, product managers, software architects, and other stakeholders to figure out opportunities for product improvement and success—and determine the right experiments to measure, test, and yield actionable insights.<br />\n <br />\nProduct managers and marketing will want to discuss how your insights inform value propositions and selling points. Designers will use your research data for their creative—prototypes, concepts, and actual product designs—and ask for your input and advice. And, of course, the entire research team needs to determine best research practices.<br />\n <br />\nOther qualities you’ll need: 3-5 years professional experience in user research or UX research, and a BA or MA in Interaction Design, Communication Design, Product Design, HCI, or something similar. A blend of strong qualitative and quantitative research skills, knack for constructing compelling insights, and understanding of standard research and design processes goes without saying.<br />\n <br />\nThis place generally looks for candidates that can think like an entrepreneur, and you might be asked to travel, in the United States and overseas.<br />\n 	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Closed	2016-08-26 20:00:15.76995	2017-01-11 01:00:09.790185	McKinsey & Company	Agency	t	Research
811	8043454	Lead Product Designer	New York, NY	Like Kleenex® and Coca-Cola®, our client’s brand has become synonymous with the product itself. When CEOs and COOs think of top-notch management consulting, they think of this ubiquitous multinational firm. Our client takes its reputation seriously. But that doesn’t mean they rest on their laurels. They’re constantly thinking of new ways to create digital technologies that transform the way businesses work.<br />\n <br />\nAnd that’s where you come in. If you’ve got over 5 years of experience in mobile and web design (ideally, in an enterprise solutions setting), plus some other nifty attributes, its Innovation group needs a <strong>Product Design Lead</strong>.<br />\n <br />\nAs Product Design Lead reporting to the group’s Director, you’ll….well, <em>take the</em> <em>lead</em> on crafting the UI, developing concepts, prototypes (interaction models, screen designs, and user workflows), wireframes, and mockups that can instantly translate into user stories as well as code.<br />\n <br />\nBut you’ll also contribute to research, ideation & concepting, and product development & delivery—which is why an ability to look at solutions conceptually <em>and </em>pragmatically is so critical. Collaboration is the name of the game here—and you’ll interface regularly with Product Management, Design, Development, Engineering, and Data Analysis. You’ll review and refine design during product development cycles, and provide input on how users would want to interact with an application. You’ll provide expertise on quantitative and qualitative user research: crafting questions, conducting activities, and translating insights. That’s why you need to show you’ve worked with numerous partners before—international partners, too.<br />\n <br />\nUser-centered and iterative design practices—not to mention solid UI skills and expertise with Invision, Adobe suite, OmniGraffle, and Sketch, as well as agile software development practices—are a must. You should want to constantly upgrade those and learn about the newest digital tools and technologies, too.<br />\n <br />\nThough collaboration—as we said—is key, you need to be self-motivating and self-directing on your own tasks, and not shy in reaching out to stakeholders for their input or support. In that sense, be a mentor and a master communicator, clear and concise on why your designs serve the user and the business. There could be some travel—domestic and overseas. Oh, and a sense of humor always helps. But not too much—not everyone loves a joker!	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Filled	2016-08-26 20:00:15.75056	2016-12-14 17:00:15.673514	McKinsey & Company	Agency	t	UX Design, Product Design, UI Design, Interaction Design

Right now, the entire organization is super-focused in particular on tackling those very first user touch points and impressions to produce effective and impactful experiences.<br />\n <br />\nThat’s where you come in.<br />\n <br />\nAs a Product Designer, you’re expected to <em>own </em>your users—buyers and sellers alike—and be their UX champion to other internal teams all throughout the product life cycle. You’ll make strategic, people-centered design decisions—underpinned by data and user research—that transform challenging workflows into simple, elegant experiences. Are you a jack-of-all-trades? You’ll thrive! Create detailed interaction flows in the morning, prototypes in the afternoon, and write simple, digestible emails the next day. Collaboration is a way of life here. Fellow designers will have your back, helping you craft cohesive UIs that support the product and the brand. And you’ll also work closely with partners from Product, Engineering, Research, Data, Support, Business, Operations, Brand Design and Marketing, supporting larger goals and strategic thinking.<br />\n <br />\nMake sure you’ve got a great book packed with user-centric UX solutions, high-quality and polished visual design, and solid information architecture. A working knowledge of HTML, SASS/CSS, and other development technologies, plus sketching and prototyping experience—is key. Your colleagues will expect you to trust in the research process. You might be asked to lead research activities! Be open-minded about ideas different than your own, but firm in your own opinions, and confident about communicating them.<br />\n <br />\nWhat might give you an edge? Print and web design know-how (and a clear grasp of pros and cons of both), global marketing campaign experience, and CMS design experience could all help.<br />\n <br />\nFinally, it&#39;s not all computers and colors here. You get to work with people who sing, clog, skateboards, build motorcycles, bike, embroider, emoji, host podcasts, make jewelry, draw comic books, and juggle literal knives.
